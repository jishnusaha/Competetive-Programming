double transform_axis(double &xt,double &yt,double angle,double originx,double originy)
{
    ///follow these notes:
    angle must be in radian
    originx,originy is the value of the new transformed axis's origin point
    and xt,yt is the point to be transformed
    
    if you want to retransform it to the former axis system then just pre calculate 
    the fromer origin firstly.if, former origin is (0,0) and new origin(3,14) just use those line
    double formerx=0,formery=0;
    transform_axis(formerx,formery,atan(3),3,14);
     
     
     ///CODE START HERE
    double xxt= (xt-originx)*cos(angle) + (yt - originy) *sin (angle);
    double yyt= (yt - originy) *cos(angle)- (xt - originx)*sin (angle);
    yt=yyt; xt=xxt;
